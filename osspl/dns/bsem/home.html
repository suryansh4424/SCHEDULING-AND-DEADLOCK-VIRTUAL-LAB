            <h2>Aim</h2>
            <p>Our aim is to show the implementation of binary semaphore as to how it helps in critical section management
              for given processes.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Semaphores are one of the easiest and best process synchronization mechanisms founded by Dijkstra in the mid-â€™90s.
              Binary Semaphore provides mutual synchronization between the processes in an operating system. It has an integer range of values from 0 to 1. 

              Basically, Binary Semaphores have two operations namely wait(P) and signal(V) operations. Both operations are atomic. Semaphore(s) can be initialized to zero or one. 
              Here atomic means that the variable on which read, modify, and update happens at the same time/moment with no pre-emption.
              Semaphores basically are used to implement critical sections in code. Critical sections are regions where only one process 
              can execute at once. There are some advantages and disadvantages of binary semaphores as well.</p>
            
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>Here are the steps to implement the binary semaphore for the virtual lab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the number of processes you want to perform the algorithm on by adding the desired amount.</li>
                    <li>After that, all you have to do is select the process you want to enter in critical section.</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <br><strong>NOTE: Do remember, as we are performing binary semaphore, the default value will be 1.
                  If it were zero, no operation will enter critical section.
                </strong>>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Using semaphores only one process can enter into a critical section. This process is also known as a mutual exclusion principle.<br>
              Mostly semaphores are machine independent which means that irrespective of the platform they can execute anytime and anywhere.
