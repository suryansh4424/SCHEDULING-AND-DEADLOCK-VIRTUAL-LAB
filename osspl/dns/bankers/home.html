            <h2>Aim</h2>
            <p>Our aim is to show the implementation of Bankers Algorithm, which is one of the
                widely known methods for deadlock prevention
            </p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by
                simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes an "s-state" check to 
                test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
                The algorithm was developed in the design process for the THE operating system and originally described (in Dutch) in EWD108.
                <br><br>
                When a new process enters a system, it must declare the maximum number of instances of each resource type that it may ever claim; clearly, that
                number may not exceed the total number of resources in the system. Also, when a process gets all its requested resources it must return them
                in a finite amount of time.</p>
            
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>Here are the steps to implement the Bankers ALgorithm for the virtual lab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the number of processes you want to perform the algorithm on by adding the desired amount.</li>
                    <li>Allocate the resources, set the maximum need and the number of non-allocated resources accordingly.</li>
                    <li>When all set, just click the submit button to execute the algorithm.</li>
                    <li>Depending on the availability and the need of resources, you can have 2 types of output:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If sufficient, we will have the order in which the processes execute as our output.</li>
                            <li>If not, we will be presented with "DeadLock!" on our screen.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>The Banker's algorithm derives its name from the fact that this algorithm could be used in a banking system to ensure that 
                the bank does not run out of resources, because the bank would never allocate its money in such a way that it can no 
                 longer satisfy the needs of all its customers.[2] By using the Banker's algorithm, the bank ensures that when customers 
                 request money the bank never leaves a safe state. If the customer's request does not cause the bank to leave a safe state, 
                the cash will be allocated, otherwise the customer must wait until some other customer deposits enough./p>
