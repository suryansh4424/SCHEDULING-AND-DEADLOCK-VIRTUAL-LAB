            <h2>Aim</h2>
            <p>Our aim is to show the implementation of counting semaphore as to how it helps in critical section management
              for given processes.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>  Counting semaphore is a synchronization tool that is used in operating systems to control the access to shared resources. 
                It is a type of semaphore that allows more than two processes to access the shared resource at the same time. 
                A counting semaphore is represented by an integer value that can be incremented or decremented by the processes.
                <br>
                The key difference between binary and counting semaphores is that binary semaphores can only take on two values,
                indicating either that a resource is available or unavailable, while counting semaphores can take on multiple values,
                indicating the number of available resources.</p>
            
            <h2>Procedure</h2>
            <p>Here are the steps to implement the counting semaphore for the virtual lab:
                <ol>
                    <li>Select the number of processes you want to perform the algorithm on by adding the desired amount.</li>
                    <li>After that, all you have to do is select the process you want to enter in critical section.</li>
                    
                </ol>
                <br><strong>NOTE: Set value greater than zero. It will accept all positive values.
                  If it were zero, no operation will enter critical section.
                </strong>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>Using semaphores only one process can enter into a critical section. This process is also known as a mutual exclusion principle.<br>
              Mostly semaphores are machine independent which means that irrespective of the platform they can execute anytime and anywhere.
