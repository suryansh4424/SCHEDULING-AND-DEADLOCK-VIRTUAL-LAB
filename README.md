# SCHEDULING-AND-DEADLOCK-VIRTUAL-LAB
project aims to provide an interactive online platform for users to explore and experiment with various scheduling algorithms

This virtual lab offers a comprehensive set of features for both educational and experimental purposes:



- Scheduling Algorithms:
Users can select from a range of scheduling algorithms, including:
First Come First Serve
Shortest Job First
Longest Job First
Round Robin
Shortest Remaining Job First
Longest Remaining Job First
Priority Preemptive
Priority Non-Preemptive
            
- Banker's Algorithm:
Users can input system resource allocation data, and the virtual lab will demonstrate how the Banker's Algorithm works to avoid deadlocks in the system. Users can experiment with resource allocation to understand deadlock prevention.



- Interactive Visualization:
The virtual lab provides an interactive visualization of how each scheduling algorithm operates. Users can observe how processes are scheduled and track the progress of each process.

- Custom Scenarios:
Users can create custom scheduling scenarios by defining the number of processes, their burst times, arrival times, priority levels, and resource allocation matrices to simulate real-world scenarios.

The "Scheduling and Deadlock Visualization Virtual Lab" project offers an interactive and educational platform for users to explore scheduling algorithms and gain insight into the operation of the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance. By providing a hands-on learning experience, this project aims to improve the understanding of critical computer science concepts.
